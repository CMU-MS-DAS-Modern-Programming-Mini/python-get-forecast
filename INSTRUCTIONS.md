# INSTRUCTIONS

* Fork this repository.
* Implement the method `get_forecast` in `script.py`.
* Make the neccesary changes to `script.py` so that is passes validation by `pycodestyle`. See the results of `pretty.yml` to verify it ran properly (or wait for the banner to turn green).
* Replace the username `CMU-MS-DAS-Modern-Programming-Mini` with your username on the lines

in `script.py`.

If you do the things above and your code words, then the two stickers in `README.md` should be labeled as `passing` instead of `failing`.

How do I know if it works?

If it works, then the code will build the file `README.md` and in the code you should be able to see a table with today's forecast.

If this happens, then submit your repo link on Canvas.
